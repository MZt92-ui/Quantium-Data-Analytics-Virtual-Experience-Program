### Characteristics of this work
Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the lasty few years who provide transactional and customer data. I work as virtually as a data analyst within the retail  analytics team, and are responsible for delivering data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions. <br>
This work is my personal attempt.  

## Project Background
To support supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year, the CATEGORY Manager for Chips wants to better understand its customer segments and how trial stores perform. 
#### Task 1
To understand types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region,
#### Task 2
Supermarkets has tried 3 different layouts in 3 trial stores for a period to test new opportunities. So, our team will support to assess whether or not the layouts should be rolled out to all their stores.  
## Methods
#### Task 1
2 datasets will be examined: transaction data and customer data (including their life stages and premium types).

Python with corresponding data analysis packages like Pandas will be used for exploratory analysis, and key findings will be presented in right figures using Excel. 
#### Task 2
Cleaned datasets from task 1 will be used for this task. We will also apply statistical knowledge to assess the performance. Key procedures are: 
-	Choose corresponding control store using the weighted statistics
-	Compare trial stores and controls stores performances

Python will be used for statistical analysis, and key findings will be presented in right figures using Excel. 

## Findings
#### Customer Segments Analysis
-	How customer segments contribute to total sales?

OLDER SINGLES/COUPLES and RETIREES contribute most to annual total sales, and this is mainly because more people in this segment bought chips
OLDER FAMILIES and YOUNG FAMILIES also contribute a large portion to total sales, but mainly because they averagely spent more on chips even for budget customers
Quite a portion of YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES purchased Chips, however, they tend to spend least averagely.
For NEW FAMILLIES,it implied that they do not like to purchase Chips as least of NEW FAMILLIES being identified, with MIDAGE SINGLES being the second least.

-	Top saled brands for different customer segments?

KETTLE,SMITHS,FORITOS are the top 3 brands for all customer segments.
When dig deeper to discover customer type, PRINGLES replaced SMITHS and become the top 3 saled brands for Mainstream YOUND SINGLES

-	Package size:

The package size has been divided into the following 5 categories: mini: 0-100g small: 100-200g medium: 200-300g large: 300-350g Jumbo: over 350g All customer segments behave similarly in terms of package size, with small (100-200g) size outstandingly accepted.

-	How customers respond to time?

for most segments, March, July, October, December see peak in sales
OLDER SINGLES/COUPLES, OLDER FAMILIES, and YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES tend to be more seasonally sensitive.

#### Trial Store Performance Analysis
-	Only trial store 77 have increases in sales and customers of statistically significance for the whole trial period.
- For trial store 86. while there is significantly increase in customers for the whole trial periods, just sales in March are recognised significantly increased.
- For trial store 88, there are significantly increases in sales and customers for 2 of 3 trial months: March and April
